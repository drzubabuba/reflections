How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's much easier to find a bug when you can see which lines of file have been changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It allows you to see differences between versions and back to old version if nessesary.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    * Your can commit whenever you want.
    * Granularity is at commiter's disposal.

    Cons: 
    * You may forget to commit when your should to do it.
    * It can be actually to late when you notice when you should have made a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more programming oriented, where several files tend to consist one logical group. On the other hand, Google Docs is primarily more targeted for documents created for human readings, in which case each single file consists a meaningful peace.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    * git log can be used to list the summaries of all the changes made to the repository.
    * git diff can be used to see what has actually changed between two given commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    * You can try changing any critical features, since you can always revert back to the point when those were working. If you find something is not working, you can git log, and try the previous versions until you find the one which works, and make diff of the last one that worked correctly and the commit following it. That result would show where and how the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    * Write my own programs
